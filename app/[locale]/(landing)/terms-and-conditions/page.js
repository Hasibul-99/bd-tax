              register/create an account where they have to provide all the
              required data in a truthful manner. Failure to provide the correct
              and complete information will cause the unavailability/incomplete
              service. Users are solely responsible for keeping their login
              credentials confidential and safe. For this reason, users are also
              required to choose passwords that meet the highest standards of
              strength and the requirements given on the website. By
              registering, users agree to be fully responsible for all
